This process repeated thousands of times per minute generates the desired toolpath. In the case of G02, the interpolation generates a circle rather than a line. As with G01, the actual toolpath of the machining takes place with the given feedrate on a path that accurately matches the ideal (in G02's case, a circle) to within very small limits. In fact, the interpolation is so precise (when all conditions are correct) that milling an interpolated circle can obviate operations such as drilling, and often even fine boring. <b>Addresses for radius or arc center:</b> G02 and G03 take either an <a href=\"#R\">R</a> address (for the radius desired on the part) or <a href=\"#I\">IJK</a> addresses (for the component vectors that define the vector from the arc start point to the arc center point). <b>Cutter comp:</b> On most controls you cannot start <a href=\"#G41\">G41</a> or <a href=\"#G42\">G42</a> in <a href=\"#G02\">G02</a> or <a href=\"#G03\">G03</a> modes.

First, M02 was created, in the days when the punched tape was expected to be short enough to be spliced into a continuous loop (which is why on old controls, M02 triggered no tape rewinding).[6] The other program-end code, M30, was added later to accommodate longer punched tapes, which were wound on a reel and thus needed rewinding before another cycle could start.[6] On many newer controls, there is no longer a difference in how the codes are executed—both act like M30."
